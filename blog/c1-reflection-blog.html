      <b>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</b>
      <br>
      I love the idea that it's just one big experiment that we are all taking part in - because that's kinda what life is right?
    <br>
      <b>What are your impressions?</b>
      <br>
      I agree that there is far more value in something when everyone is engaged and involved with the outcome. I have a lot of respect for DBC/EDA's honesty in presenting this as 'we are all in this together' and the onus as to how much success it brings is on all of us.
      <br>
      <b>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</b>
      <br>
      I prefer to work as a collective, rather than hierarchies. I think this gives the group freedom to do what they need to do in order to achieve, instead of being squashed by rules. I can see myself feeling comfortable and encouraged to try new ideas with EDA, and I feel excited about what can come of this for us!
      <br>
      <b>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</b>
      <br>
      It's still all sounding great to me!
      <br>
      <b>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</b>
      <br>
      I'm mainly excited. I have a teaching background and one of the big topics in education right now is learning environments, so I'm looking forward to taking part in a modern learning space. Because it's different to what I've experienced in the past, it's likely this will push me out of my comfort zones and I suppose that makes me nervous. But the fear is all part of the adventure!
