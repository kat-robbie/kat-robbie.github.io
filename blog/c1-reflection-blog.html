    <p>
      What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?
      I love the idea that it's just one big experiment that we are all taking part in - because that's kinda what life is right?
    </p>
    <p>
      What are your impressions?
      I agree that there is far more value in something when everyone is engaged and involved with the outcome. I have a lot of respect for DBC/EDA's honesty in presenting this as 'we are all in this together' and the onus as to how much success it brings is on all of us.

      How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
      I prefer to work as a collective, rather than hierarchies. I think this gives the group freedom to do what they need to do in order to achieve, instead of being squashed by rules. I can see myself feeling comfortable and encouraged to try new ideas with EDA, and I feel excited about what can come of this for us!
    </p>
    <p>
      Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?
      It's still all sounding great to me!

      Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
      I'm mainly excited. I have a teaching background and one of the big topics in education right now is learning environments, so I'm looking forward to taking part in a modern learning space. Because it's different to what I've experienced in the past, it's likely this will push me out of my comfort zones and I suppose that makes me nervous. But the fear is all part of the adventure!
