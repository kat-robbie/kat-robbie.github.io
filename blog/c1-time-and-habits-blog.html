    <h1>Time and Habit Techniques</h1>


    <p>
      Meditation is a technique that I've dabbled into in the past, but never had great success. I regulary do yoga, but even when a teacher is guiding me in the mediatation part of the class, I often let my mind drift (often to think about my next meal), or I almost fall asleep. However, after reading about how fabulous the 'Power of Meditation' can be, I feel compelled to give meditation a better go, and try creating a new habit with it.
      I also found the concept of the Pomodoro technique to be really interesting. I can be very easily distracted (I'm actually going back and forth between flossing my teeth and writing this), so having a set amount of time to focus completely in one thing would probably be really beneficial. I am going to research it further, find myself a sweet tomtato timer, and give it a try.
