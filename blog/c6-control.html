  <h3>Control</h3>
    <p>
      When programming, one thing that really triggers me is thinking/talking about all the other things in my life that need to get done. This trigger has been particularly relevant recently as I pack up my life and move cities. My response is to completely lose site of the current task I’m working on, and quickly lose perspective on everything else as well.  I’m coming to realise that when I’ve set time aside for coding, it needs to be a time when I strictly don’t have conversations about other things on the ‘to-do list’.
      <br>
      Breathing is a fantastic way to calm the mind, and after undertaking Siberian North Railroad exercise I felt much more relaxed. I hope I will remember this technique in the next trigger scenario that comes up.
