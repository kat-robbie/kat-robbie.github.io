    <h1>JavaScript Basics</h1>
        <p>
         <b>JavaScript is far more interactive compared to the static HTML and CSS</b>. JavaScript enables conversation with the computer, instead of straightforward commands.
        </br>
         <b>Control loops</b> can be like making breakfast.  Jim loves eggs. IF Jim has eggs in his house, he will always eat eggs for breakfast. Or ELSE, if Jim is out of eggs, he will have toast. Jim eats his eggs boiled. He will boil each egg in water for a LOOP for precisely 6 minutes, before he takes them out and lets them cool in cold water (as this makes the eggs easier to peel).
        </br>
         <b>Arrays are subclasses of Objects</b>, which means an Array inherits all features from Objects. However, to specifically access data from Arrays, square bracket notations [] need to be used.
       </br>
         In JavaScript, <b>a function is a set of rules</b> that instruct how to perform a task or calculate a value. In order to use a function, it must be defined before something invokes, or ‘calls’ it. JavaScript code is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().</p>
