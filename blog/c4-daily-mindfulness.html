  <h3>Daily Mindfulness</h3>
      <p>
        <b>From doing the mindfulness conversation</b>, I leant that one can fit a lot into 3 minutes! It is rare in day to day life that an individual gets a whole three minutes to indulge in. My partner found it to be also reaffirming to be able to take 3 minutes to talk.
        <b>Three techniques</b> that I will use to sustain my practise includes the walking meditation - which sounds like a great idea! I really like the of mindfully standing, then taking one step and being conscious of how the foot moves. The simple practise of taking one decent, long, big breath each day is a realistic and forgiving practise for someone like myself who has trouble sustaining daily mindfulness when live gets in the way. I also really enjoyed the concept of mindful conversation with another person. The activity was beneficial to my relationship with that person, and it was good practise to actively listen for 3 minutes. This is definitely something that I will try again.</p>
