   <h3>Connecting</h3>
        <p>I have been able to use the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity. Recently I have been in a situation with organizing living arrangements for a group of people, and needed to make decisions based on what was best for the group overall in compliance with the landlord. The most important aspect I found was giving other members of the group the time to be listened to â€“ which I applied the technique of empathic listening. Once they felt understood, and in turn understood the situation themselves, they could support the decision making.
        <br>
        I found the loving kindness meditation to be really refreshing, and an excellent remedy for clearing a bad mood and stress.

        A political situation in the past in which brought up conflict occurred at a previous workplace. I had been in my position for 18 months and had some good relationship with my manager, and as long as I did my work, I had a lot of flexibility with my hours. However, when my manager was replaced with a new manager with a micro-managing style, my hours were changed so that I had to do the exact same hours everyday, which no room for flexibility. This made me feel suffocated and not valued as an independent employee.
        <br>
        However, my new manager was new to the role of managing staff, and therefore felt that they needed to set the new precedent early to gain respect of the staff. To make it fair for everyone, they enforced the adjustment of the hours for all staff. Staff were told that this system would be a trial, and if ineffective, would be up for review later.
        <br>
        It was a difficult situation as we both felt strongly about our positions!
