  <h3>Self Confidence</h3>
    <p>
      <b>The relationship between mindfulness and self awareness </b>is a very close one. Indeed, they are pretty much the same thing. One interesting point that the author highlighted from this notion is that if mindfulness that can be learned, or trained, so to can self awareness. This is reassuring to note, as it means that self awareness is a skill that everyone should work towards.

      <b>Journaling</b> is something that I did a lot of in my teens and early twenties, but I have now got out of the habit of regularly writing - which is a shame. However, trying journaling again as a self awareness practise was an excellent motivation to get back into it. I am, and always have been, a rambler in my writing. In the three minutes I gave myself to write, I wrote a lot! It was interesting to be writing on a computer, as back when I was younger, I always wrote with pen and paper. It seems I can type much faster than I write. I felt this journal session was very cathartic for me. My life situation is currently going through a lot of changes as I quit my job, give away most of my belongings and prepare to move cities, so giving myself the time and space to address the emotions associated with change is really beneficial.

      <b>From the “My Emotions are Not Me” section,</b> I resonated strongly with the idea that emotions are fluid, and while a current emotion can be strong and overwhelming, it doesn’t last forever. Sometimes that realisation can be hard to grasp in difficult times. I feel very comforted by the idea that emotions of the present state do not dictate one’s whole being.
