            A <b>Responsive site </b> is a website that will adjust to fit the size of the screen that is viewing it. It is important because people access the internet through a varity of devices, all with differing screen sizes and ways to use them (ie a mouse or touch screen). Web developers need to take this into account when designing websites so that information is easy to access for everyone.
         <br>
            <b>Mobile first design</b> is designing a website to be viewed on a mobile, before designing for another devices, such as desktop. This makes the page display faster on smaller devices. This is important because a large proportion of people use the internet through mobile devices, some exclusively, so websites need to accomodate this.
        <br>
            <b>Framesworks</b> are a package of structured files and folders of code that can be used as a basis to build websites upon. Frameworks allow designers and developers to concentrate on unique features of their work, rather than 're-inventing the wheel' and spending time coding the common features shared by many already existing websites.
            The advantage to using frameworks is effeciency. Because a framework user doesn't need to spend time writing repetitive code to set up the basics of a site, they can finish a project much faster.  Many popular coding language frameworks are open source, and without restrictive licesning, so they are easy for people to obtain and use to build a commercial site. Popular frameworks often come with good documentation, with a communty of supportive users behind it. Added to this is the bonus of security, as many developers have tested the framework as it is built so many security risks have been addressed.
            However, the disadvantage to using frameworks are the limitations of what can be achieved within a single framework. Performance can also suffer under some framworks, particularly for mobile users. While eventually making life easier for developers and designers, frameworks can initially be a steep learning curve, needing substantial time and practise to master it.

            A <b>Wireframe </b> is a mock up of a webpage, made up in boxes. This helps web developers get an idea of how a webpage will be designed.
