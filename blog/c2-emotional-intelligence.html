    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
       <p>
          It is encouraging to read that emotional intelligence can be trained and developed, even as adults. By being aware of how to perceive emotion in our bodies' through reactions, we can learn a lot about ourselves. A high-resolution perception, or the ability to being able to identify emotions rising in our bodies, is a useful tool for any situation. I am interested in developing this further in myself, and looking at different solutions for managing emotions.

          I achieved the two minutes of mindfulness by sitting on the beach and letting myself be blown about in the wind. It certainly took my mind off other things, but I think I'll aim for somewhere a little calmer next time.
