        <h3>Meditation Musings</h3>
          <p>
            Iâ€™ve known that meditation was a really beneficial and healthy habit, but have       struggled to practise it regularly in my own life.

            I like how Search Inside Yourself opens up meditation as a practise for everyone in everyday lives, as opposed to being strictly spiritual, which is the impression that I get from other meditation readings.

            A meditation technique that stands out to me is the practise of taking 5 breaths before reacting to something. For example, while meditating, if I get an itch or a distraction, I want to try taking 5 breaths before choosing to react.
