    <h3>Motivation</h3>
      <p>
        The ‘pleasure, passion and purpose’ lens makes a lot of sense. I can recognise the things in my life that make me fleetingly happy, and the things that keep me driven for a period of time, as opposed to the wider perspective that things with a higher purpose deliver. When life gets difficult, it is good to be able to recognise the things that give a sense of higher purpose happiness.
      <br>
        An important core value for me is respect. Respect for other people, their beliefs, culture and self expression. Respecting and protecting the world we live in is another value that is important to me.  So, standing up for human rights and environmentalism is two of the most worthwhile causes in my mind.
      <br>
        After the resilience ideas and mediation exercise, I felt a little stronger and more confident in taking on challenges. I felt that keeping a positive mind when things aren’t going well was easier after I could refer back to this.
