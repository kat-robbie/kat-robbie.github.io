  <h1>On being 'blocked up', and Arrays</h1>
      <p>
        I regularly find myself blocked up on the simplest of things. In all honesty, there have been many moments when I have got myself into quite a state over a mere curly bracket! The best problem solving technique for me is to take a break. If there is the luxury of leaving it overnight, this works out best for me. However, sometimes there just isn't time, so stepping outside for some fresh air, or making a cup of tea, is better than nothing. This helps relieve the desperate frustration that goes on while staring at the screen and missing the tiny detail that's right in front of me. Throughout Phase 0, I have become quite familiar to this predicament. Fortunately, the more I get 'blocked up', the more I stay calm and 'elegantly' work through the issue with well timed breaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel confident using many of the problem solving techniques and processes. My first instinct is to tackle it headfirst with trying something/trouble shooting. Reaching out to peers and coaches is also something that is usually very helpful and worthwhile. As a millennial, googling an issue is like second nature too. At this point, reading error messages isn't always so useful, but as I learn more, I am likely to be able to make better sense of what the machine is conveying. Pseudocode is something I'm not yet in the habit of using, so this is something that I will work on in the upcoming weeks.

      <p>Three Array function definitions:
      <br>
       <b>.map()</b>
       <br>
       The .map() function creates a new array, that provides information or results for each element in the array, in order.
       <br>
       <b>.filter()</b>
       The .filter() function creates a new array which includes all the array elements that pass a test as provided in the function.
       <br>
       <b>.reduce()</b>
       The .reduce() function minimizes an array to a single value. This method reads the provided function of each value from left to right, and returns results stored in what is called an accumulator.
