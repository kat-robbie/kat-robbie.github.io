    <h3>Leadership</h3>
      <p>
        In my experience of compassionate leadership, the leader has been a friend to all in the group. They took the time to get to know each individual so that they can ask the right questions and make relative suggestions when difficult situations arise.

        The multiplying goodness meditation made me feel more open and positive to other people. In fact, when walking down the street shortly afterwards, I was more inclined to smile at strangers as they passed, and felt more engaged when I met friends later on that day.
        <br>
        This time around, I did not try the Tonglen meditation because after reading the recommendation in the book, I felt I wasnâ€™t quite ready for it. This is something that perhaps I would like to try after more meditation practise.

        The SCARF model applied to Phase 0 in communication. It can be intimidating to share online with people that have never met in person. Remembering that others are just people too, and they have the same drivers of social behaviour with status, certainty, autonomy, relatedness and fairness. SCARF will also apply to bootcamp as the group is put into new and challenging situations that require a lot of team work. Having a greater understanding of how the human brain works in these social situations will be an asset for compassionate group workings.

        A difficult situation which I had to have recently was with a friend who was creating situations which was hurting others. Although this friend was clearly in the wrong, it was important for them to be able to express their side of the story and be listened too. It was only after they felt they had been understood, that they then could understand how the other side was feeling. We could then come up with solutions on how to remedy the situation.
