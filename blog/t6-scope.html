      <h3>Scope</h3>

        <p>
          In computer science, <b>Scope</b> is the set of variables that can be accessed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way scope works in JavaScript differs from scope in other languages. In JavaScript, objects and functions are also variables, which means they are also considered scope. Function scope in JavaScript is the scope changes inside functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          A key point to remember is the difference between where a variable is placed within the script. Variables can be considered either <b>Local</b> or <b>Global</b>, and it is whether they are declared in a function, or not, that defines the local or global status.
        </p>
        <p>
          Variables that are declared within a JavaScript function are local to the function. They can only be accessed within the function, so they have <b>local scope</b>. When a function starts, a local variable is created. It is then deleted when the function is completed.
        </p>
        <p>
          A global variable is one that is declared outside of a function, so it has <b>global scope</b>. This means that all scripts and functions on a webpage can access it. Unlike local variable, global variables will remain part of a webpage until the browser is closed.It is advised they you do not create global variables unless you specifically intend to.
