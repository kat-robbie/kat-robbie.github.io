<b>An analogy to describe HTML, CSS and DOM</b> could be found in us! The way our bodies work inside is like HTML, the CSS is like how we look on the outside, and the DOM is how we move and interact with consciousness.
<br>
HTML is like our physical bodies - below the skin, we are basically all the same. Our digestive systems, nervous systems etc all function with the same structure.
<br>
CSS is how our bodies are different on the outside. Humans are made up of a range of different skin types, hair, eye colour, and sizes. These colours and styles can be altered by things such as cosmetics and clothing, just like CSS can be used to change colour and style elements.
<br>
DOM is like our consciousness. It takes the physical rules of our basic body functions, and brings us alive in movement, personality and ability. Like the DOM brings a webpage to life, so too does consciousness bring our bodies to life.

<p>
<b>Boxifying design</b> is basically breaking down a design into boxes. This can be done with a few boxes, or it could be broken down to as many boxes as possible. This is to reflect the idea that web design with HTML is made up of boxes. With HTML you can distinguish these boxes with ‘div’ tags, and then they can be labeled with ‘class attributes’.
<br>
The box model is the way that a webpage is divided up visually with boxes. The boxes are made up as the ‘margin’ the ‘border’, the ‘padding’ and the ‘content’.
The content is at the centre of the page, containing the text or image, and the surrounding boxes work to protect it, to ensure other parts of the page don’t overlap or sit too close. This helps to keep the page aesthetically pleasing.
