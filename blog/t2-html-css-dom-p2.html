  <h1>Webpage Structure</h1>
  <p>
    <b>What is grid based design?</b>
Grid based design is the practise in which web designs are divided up by the way our eyes naturally follow patterns as we read. This pattern goes from left to right, and top to bottom. For example, titles are placed at the top of pages because they are the first thing people will see when they look at a website. You can see how a webpage is broken down into grids by drawing boxes around the content. This structure is controlled by CSS. The best practice for this is by using a collection of CSS classes called Frameworks.

 <b>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</b>
 With people accessing the Internet on a variety of devices and screen sizes, it’s important to have responsive webpages. A responsive webpage is one that will resize its content automatically to fit the screen resolution that it is being displayed on.
 <br>
<b>What is semantic structure?</b>
Semantic tags are labels that make sense to  computer, but also to the humans looking at them. The < h1 > heading tag is an example of semantic structure. This helps to organise information on a page.

 <b>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on:</b>
The suggestion to use Google fonts has opened up a whole new world for me. Typography has always interested me, so I’m looking forward to spending the time to play with this!
