[A complete (and visual) guide to Flex box](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)


## Overview
Great visual references and descriptions

> The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module (currently a W3C Last Call Working Draft) aims at providing a more
> efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is
> unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word "flex").

> The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items' width/height
> (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and
> screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space, or shrinks them to prevent
> overflow.
