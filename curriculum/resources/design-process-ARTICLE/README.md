# Design and Development Process

## Overview
Having a process and a plan of action is important when developing websites and web applications. Each designer / developer / agency will have a unique take on the design process, but most use similar phases and elements.

It's up to you to understand the importance of process, experiment a bit and develop your own.

### A typical process:
Below is an example of a design and development process. Your initial `username.github.io` website won't require such in-depth analysis, planning and design, but as the course continues you'll need a good understanding and application of process when designing your web projects.


#### Phase 1: Analysis and information gathering
- Website purpose
- Website goals
- Target audience
- Brain storm

<!-- DBC start -->
It is good to ask yourself:
  1. What is your site's primary goal or purpose?
  2. What kind of content will your site feature?
  3. What is the best way to share that content with users?
  4. Think about your target audience. What are their interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
  5. How do you think most users will find your site?
  6. What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
