# HTML Basics with Code Academy (External)
[Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web)

## Overview
Code Academy takes a simple step by step approach to helping learn the basics of HTML and CSS. **Note** Its bad practice to style HTML from within the HTML file, but despite this, you are required to do this to complete some of the Code Academy steps. **We recommend skipping steps that involve using the `style` attribute e.g. `<p style=>`
  - **Unit One:** Intro to HTML  
    Lesson: *HTML Basics I*
    - Why learn HTML
    - HTML and CSS
    - Basic terminology
    - Paragraphs `<p>`
    - Body `<body>`
    - Body elements e.g. `<h1>`
    - Adding images `<img>`
    - Linking images `<img src=>`

    *Lesson: Build a simple website*  
    - Use the topics from the previous HTML basics lesson to build simple HTML   


  - **Unit Two:** HTLM Structure: *Using lists*  
    Lesson: *HTML Basics II* (do only steps 1-6)  
    - Indentation  
    - Lists `<li>` `<ol>` `<ul>`
    - Making comments

    *Skip steps 7 onwards - It's bad practice to style HTML directly (style should be in its on own CSS file)  

  - **Unit Three:** HTML Structure: *Tables, Divs, Spans  
    Lesson: *HTML Basics III*  
    - Tables `<table>`
    - Rows `<tr>`
