In software engineering, *don't repeat yourself* (DRY) is principal of software development, aimed at reducing repetition of information. For that reason, we put our energy into not only creating our own tutorials, but finding the gems that already exist

## How to use
While it is possible to navigate the resource list, it is not intended to be used this way. Resources are linked to via the weekly assignment and concept material
