# Command Line

## Overview
The command line (a.k.a terminal, shell, prompt) is another way of interacting with your computer. Instead of working with windows, toolbars, menus, and buttons, you're just interacting with text.

## Prerequisites
None

## Capabilities
You are comfortable using the command line tool to:

- Make a directory using `mkdir`
- Identify your current directory using `pwd`
- List items in a directory using `ls`
- Navigate paths, folders, directories using `cd`
- Remove directory using `rm -r`
- Making empty files using `touch`
- Copying a file using `cp`
- Moving a file using `mv`
- Viewing a file using `cat`
- Removing a file using `rm`
- Wildcard matching using `*`

## Stretch

If you're happy with the above and are ready for more, find out how to:

- Redirecting output to a file using `>`
- Append to the end of a file using `>>`
- Piping output to another command using `|`
