# Libraries

## Overview
A Library is a tool. A Framework is a way of life.  
e.g JQuery is a Javascript library, Bootstrap/Skeleton are CSS frameworks

Here are a variety of examples rephrased in different ways:

- A Library you can use whatever tiny part helps you. A Framework you must commit your entire project to.
- A Library provides a set of functions that you can use in your code.
- A Framework embodies some abstract design, with more behavior built in. A framework is an architecture which you design your code around.

A small example of using a library:
Jquery's dollar sign selector:   
`$(".my-class)`, compared with the
vanilla Javascript:  
`document.getElementsByClassName("my-class")`

### Good
- Using a good library for the right job can result in a cleaner, more reliable web app than home made code - good libraries are well tested, and have had many iterations to remove common issues
- Using libraries can save a lot of time

### Bad 
- Using libraries introduces dependencies on third party code, so pick a library that is stable enough
- Using a library instead of building something from scratch removes a learning opportunity
- If you reach the limitations of a complex library it can be difficult to extend
- You have to learn a new syntax, a bit like learning another language.
