# Events

## Overview

One of the most common programming _paradigms_ used in JavaScript is [event-driven programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming). Understanding events (such as a mouse click) and event handling (what our program _does_ when the user clicks the mouse) are crucial to writing programs that will run in the browser and, increasingly, in mobile and desktop applications written in JavaScript.
