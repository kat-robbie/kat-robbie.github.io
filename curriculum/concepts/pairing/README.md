# Pair Programming (Pairing)

## Overview
Pair programming is an Agile software development technique in which two programmers work as a pair together on one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the navigator, focuses on the bigger picture, and immediately spots mistakes. 

Together, the programmers help each other hold strong attention on the task.

It is a simple but very effective tool.

Watch Fiona and Semira's explanation for an explanation of how to pair program.

Then watch Codr.tv's episode on Pair Programming to hear about how pairing is used as a tool in the industry.

## Environment
The options we've found for pairing, in order of effectiveness, are:

1. Pair in person - arrange a time to meet up somewhere.
2. Video call<sup>&#42;</sup> + working collaboratively on a remote computer - Cloud9.
3. Video call<sup>&#42;</sup> + screen share.

**If you can't meet up in person, and you don't have adequate internet connection for options 2 or 3, you won't have adequate communication lines to pair program.** Instead, you can get some of the benefits with:

1. Phone call + Slack to discuss approaches, ideas and issues.
2. Share pseudocode and code on Slack.

<sup>&#42;</sup> Skype/Google Hangouts/Zoom/Appear.in etc.

## Prerequisites

None

## Capabilities

You are comfortable:

 - taking time to check in with another person before coding together
 - understanding how to use pair programming effectively
