# Process over product

## Overview
Argh I have to design an entirely responsive site!!! panic panic panic

wait - remember this mantra:

‘process over product’

This is something you should take with you during your entire EDA experience. It applies to the individual assignments, and even the final project!

Often, you’ll be working through the curriculum, struggling through the concepts and produce a munted wonky website where the CSS jumps everywhere, and nothing works, meanwhile...

...another person in your cohort has a smooth bootstrapped site with js animations! Arghh!

It’s ok! 

The comparison doesn’t matter. What matters is that you have engaged with the material, and given it a go. If you've been holding attention, you'll have learnt a lot, even if it doesn't feel like it. If you’ve given it a good shot, and are still struggling, get help ASAP from your cohort - if that's not helping unblock you, message your coaches and move on.

Your focus is learning, not producing products (yet). Make the most of it.

Time boxing is a great tool to stay focussed on learning, and move onto other learnings rather than falling into perfecting a product.

so the divs in your blog might not align - but that’s ok - the point is that you’re doing it.

Play, try things that you might not perfect, explore!

## Prerequisites

None
