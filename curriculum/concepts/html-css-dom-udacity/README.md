# HTML, CSS and the DOM

## Overview

HTML and CSS are two of the fundamental languages found almost everywhere on the web. The Document Object Model provides the means to interact with objects in an HTML document. Throughout the bootcamp and your career as a web developer, you'll be parsing and manipulating the DOM. Get comfy: this is your new home!

## Prerequisites

- None

## Capabilities

At the completion of the Udacity _Not Your Typical Intro to Web Dev_ course, you should be comfortable:

 - Turning a design document into a web page
 - Using a custom CSS framework to style your project
 - Experiment with Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework. You'll see Bootstrap all over the place after you graduate!

## Resources

This concept is directly linked to the Udacity HTML and CSS assignment in your waffle board. Please view the assignment before accessing the [lesson links](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-html-and-css--ud304).
