# Reading Documentation
Know thy tools.

## Overview
How do working web developers learn new things? They start with the documentation! 
This is a rich source of information.

**Docs arenâ€™t designed so you have to painstakingly read every word.**

Documentation can be designed to cater to a huge range of skill levels. This means you have to develop the skills to filter out what is useful to you. The documentation may assume a lot of knowledge. The documentation may be incomplete or messy. The documentation may be beautiful.

Skimming over the documentation is the best way to familiarise yourself with a new thing.

**If you are familiar with the capabilities of your tools, you will build awesomer things and write elegant code.**

Hot tips:
- Look for code examples
- Try the code examples for yourself
- Use page search ctrl+f/cmd+f to search keywords (functions, actions etc.)
